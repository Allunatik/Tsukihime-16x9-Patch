## About
This patches the game to be rendered in a resolution of 1920x1080. All game assets such as sprites, UI elements, backgrounds, CG's have been upscaled to high fidelity ones. Menus have been remade and their corresponding elements replaced to utilize the wider aspect ratio. CG's and backgrounds ingame are zoomed as stretching these would ruin the presentation.

## Textboxes
The patch contains three different textboxes to choose from
- Centered

## Automode
You may toggle auto mode by pressing the 'A' Key on your keyboard

## Known issues
- Windows display scaling will zoom the game window
If your game is zoomed in go to your display options and make sure that scaling is set to 100%, partial scaling values break this patch due to the way ONScripter handles this.
